## Introduction

The original plan was for Xubuntu to be published on October 13, 2005, along with Ubuntu 
5.10 Breezy Badger, but the project was not finished by then. Rather, the xubuntu-desktop 
metapackage, which was accessible via the Synaptic Package Manager and installed the Xfce 
desktop, was referred to by the Xubuntu name.  


Under Jani Monoses' leadership, the first official version of Xubuntu was made available on 
June 1, 2006, as part of the Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake line, which also featured Kubuntu and 
Edubuntu.  


The Xubuntu Strategy Document is a thorough plan that Cody A.W. Somerville created for 
the Xubuntu project.The Ubuntu Community Council gave their approval to this document in 
2008. 


Cody Somerville announced his resignation as project manager in November 2009 and issued 
a request for nominations to assist in selecting a replacement. On January 10, 2010, the 
Xubuntu community officially recognized Lionel as the new project leader, and he asked for 
the establishment of an official Xubuntu council.  


The Xubuntu team started the process of moving the project away from having a single 
project leader and toward council management at the beginning of 2016. The Xubuntu 
Council was formally established on January 1, 2017, according to a post on the Xubuntu 
website's blog. In addition to making choices regarding the project's future, the council's role 
also includes ensuring that the project's course follows the rules outlined in the Strategy 
Document.

## Installation steps

Hre are the installatiion processes step by step


## Common Issues and Solutions

While installing and working with Xubuntu, we would encounter several challenges that 
requires troubleshooting. Below are the most notable issues we face and the approaches we 
can use to resolve them. 


1. Booting Problems

   
  - Issue: The system failed to boot from the USB installation media. 
  - Solution: After verifying that the bootable USB was created properly using Rufus, adjust the 
BIOS settings to ensure the system prioritized USB boot. Switching between UEFI and 
Legacy modes was also necessary, depending on how the installation media had been 
configured.

 
2. Disk Partitioning Errors

   
  - Issue: During installation, an error stating ‚ÄúNo root file system defined‚Äù appeared. 
  - Solution: select the manual partitioning option and ensured that a root partition (/) was 
defined using the ext4 file system. This step was essential for the installer to proceed 
correctly.


3. Hardware Compatibility

    
  - Issue: Some hardware components, particularly Wi-Fi and graphics drivers, did not function 
correctly after installation. 
  - Solution: use Xubuntu‚Äôs built-in ‚ÄúAdditional Drivers‚Äù utility to install the recommended 
proprietary drivers. For components not automatically supported, refer to official forums and 
community documentation, which provided reliable solutions.


4. Performance Limitations on Older Hardware

   
  - Issue: Despite Xubuntu‚Äôs lightweight design, performance was sluggish on very old 
hardware. 
  - Solution: review the minimum system requirements and disabled unnecessary startup 
applications to free up memory. In some cases, hardware upgrades may be the only viable 
long-term solution.


5. Internet Connectivity During Installation

     
  - Issue: Without a working Wi-Fi driver, the installer could not download updates or language 
packs. 
  - Solution: connect the system directly to a router via Ethernet. After installation, I manually 
installed missing drivers to enable wireless connectivity.


6. UEFI and Legacy Boot Mode Confusion

    
  - Issue: The installation failed due to a mismatch between the system‚Äôs boot mode and the 
partition table (GPT vs MBR). 
  - Solution: ensure consistency by booting the installation media in the same mode as the target 
system. For UEFI mode, I used a GPT partition scheme; for Legacy mode, MBR.


7. Slow Installation Process 


  - Issue: One of the installation attempts took unusually long to complete. 
  - Solution:  check the integrity of the ISO file and recreated the bootable USB on a different 
flash drive. The process was significantly faster after doing so. 


8. BIOS Prompt for Confirmation Key

    
  - Issue: During installation, the BIOS repeatedly prompted for a security confirmation key, 
which delayed progress. 
  - Solution: After researching the specific BIOS error and cross-checking with my system 
manufacturer‚Äôs documentation, locate the correct key and was able to proceed.

## File System Support

As a Linux-based distribution, Xubuntu supports a diverse range of file systems, allowing it 
to adapt to various storage needs and system configurations. Its default file system, ext4, is 
well-regarded within the Linux community for its robustness, high performance, and 
compatibility with large volumes. Additionally, its journaling feature plays a critical role in 
maintaining data integrity following unexpected shutdowns or crashes. 


Beyond ***ext4***, Xubuntu extends support to: 


- **Btrfs**, which is designed for users who prioritize features like compression, snapshots, 
and subvolume management. Its scalability and advanced configuration options make 
it well-suited for more complex setups. 
- **ZFS**, known for its strong focus on data integrity and reliability. Features such as 
copy-on-write and checksumming are particularly useful in environments where 
consistent and secure data handling is essential. 
For users who work across platforms, particularly with Windows systems, Xubuntu also 
supports: 
- **NTFS**, commonly used for dual-boot scenarios or shared drives. While not optimized 
for Linux-native operations, it remains useful for file exchange between operating 
systems. 
- **FAT32**, a widely supported file system that is functional across nearly all devices. 
However, its 4GB maximum file size and limited feature set make it less suitable for 
modern storage needs. 
- **exFAT**, developed to address some of FAT32‚Äôs limitations, supports larger files and 
is ideal for use on USB flash drives and SD cards. Although not supported natively in 
older Linux distributions, modern Xubuntu releases include the necessary drivers.

## Virtualization

Virtualization is technology that you can use to create virtual representations of servers, 
storage, networks, and other physical machines. Virtual software mimics the functions of 
physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical 
machine. Businesses use virtualization to use their hardware resources efficiently and get 
greater returns from their investment. It also powers cloud computing services that help 
organizations manage infrastructure more efficiently. 


**Why is virtualization important?**


By using virtualization, you can interact with any hardware resource with greater flexibility. 
Physical servers consume electricity, take up storage space, and need maintenance. You are 
often limited by physical proximity and network design if you want to access them. 
Virtualization removes all these limitations by abstracting physical hardware functionality 
into software. You can manage, maintain, and use your hardware infrastructure like an 
application on the web.


**What is virtualization?**


To properly understand Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), you first need to understand 
some basic concepts in virtualization. Virtualization is a process that allows a computer to 
share its hardware resources with multiple digitally separated environments. Each virtualized 
environment runs within its allocated resources, such as memory, processing power, and 
storage. With virtualization, organizations can switch between different operating systems on 
the same server without rebooting.  


Virtual machines and hypervisors are two important concepts in virtualization. 


- **Virtual machine**
  
A virtual machine is a software-defined computer that runs on a physical computer with a 
separate operating system and computing resources. The physical computer is called the host 
 machine and virtual machines are guest machines. Multiple virtual machines can run on a 
single physical machine. Virtual machines are abstracted from the computer hardware by a 
hypervisor.


- **Hypervisor**

 
The hypervisor is a software component that manages multiple virtual machines in a 
computer. It ensures that each virtual machine gets the allocated resources and does not 
interfere with the operation of other virtual machines. There are two types of hypervisors.


- Type 1 hypervisor

  
A type 1 hypervisor, or bare-metal hypervisor, is a hypervisor program installed directly on 
the computer‚Äôs hardware instead of the operating system. Therefore, type 1 hypervisors have 
better performance and are commonly used by enterprise applications. KVM uses the type 1 
hypervisor to host multiple virtual machines on the Linux operating system. 


- Type 2 hypervisor

  
Also known as a hosted hypervisor, the type 2 hypervisor is installed on an operating system. 
Type 2 hypervisors are suitable for end-user computing.


**What are the benefits of virtualization?**


Virtualization provides several benefits to any organization: 


- Efficient resource use 
Virtualization improves hardware resources used in your data center. For example, instead of 
running one server on one computer system, you can create a virtual server pool on the same 
computer system by using and returning servers to the pool as required. Having fewer 
underlying physical servers frees up space in your data center and saves money on electricity, 
generators, and cooling appliances.  
- Automated IT management 
Now that physical computers are virtual, you can manage them by using software tools. 
Administrators create deployment and configuration programs to define virtual machine 
templates. You can duplicate your infrastructure repeatedly and consistently and avoid error
prone manual configurations. 
- Faster disaster recovery 
When events such as natural disasters or cyberattacks negatively affect business operations, 
regaining access to IT infrastructure and replacing or fixing a physical server can take hours 
or even days. By contrast, the process takes minutes with virtualized environments. This 
prompt response significantly improves resiliency and facilitates business continuity so that 
operations can continue as scheduled.   


**How does virtualization work?**


Virtualization uses specialized software, called a hypervisor, to create several cloud instances 
or virtual machines on one physical computer.


Cloud instances or virtual machines 


After you install virtualization software on your computer, you can create one or more virtual 
machines. You can access the virtual machines in the same way that you access other 
applications on your computer. Your computer is called the host, and the virtual machine is 
called the guest. Several guests can run on the host. Each guest has its own operating system, 
which can be the same or different from the host operating system.  
From the user‚Äôs perspective, the virtual machine operates like a typical server. It has settings, 
configurations, and installed applications. Computing resources, such as central processing 
units (CPUs), Random Access Memory (RAM), and storage appear the same as on a physical 
server. You can also configure and update the guest operating systems and their applications 
as necessary without affecting the host operating system. 


Hypervisors 


The hypervisor is the virtualization software that you install on your physical machine. It is a 
software layer that acts as an intermediary between the virtual machines and the underlying 
hardware or host operating system. The hypervisor coordinates access to the physical 
environment so that several virtual machines have access to their own share of physical 
resources.  
For example, if the virtual machine requires computing resources, such as computer 
processing power, the request first goes to the hypervisor. The hypervisor then passes the 
request to the underlying hardware, which performs the task.  
The following are the two main types of hypervisors. 


- Type 1 hypervisors 


A type 1 hypervisor‚Äîalso called a bare-metal hypervisor‚Äîruns directly on the computer 
hardware. It has some operating system capabilities and is highly efficient because it interacts 
directly with the physical resources.  


- Type 2 hypervisors  


A type 2 hypervisor runs as an application on computer hardware with an existing operating 
system. Use this type of hypervisor when running multiple operating systems on a single 
machine.  


**What are the different types of virtualization?**


You can use virtualization technology to get the functions of many different types of physical 
infrastructure and all the benefits of a virtualized environment. You can go beyond virtual 
machines to create a collection of virtual resources in your virtual environment.  

 
**Server virtualization** 


Server virtualization is a process that partitions a physical server into multiple virtual servers. 
It is an efficient and cost-effective way to use server resources and deploy IT services in an 
organization. Without server virtualization, physical servers use only a small amount of their 
processing capacities, which leave devices idle. 


**Storage virtualization** 


Storage virtualization combines the functions of physical storage devices such as network 
attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). You can pool the storage hardware 
in your data center, even if it is from different vendors or of different types. Storage 
virtualization uses all your physical data storage and creates a large unit of virtual storage that 
you can assign and control by using management software. IT administrators can streamline 
storage activities, such as archiving, backup, and recovery, because they can combine 
multiple network storage devices virtually into a single storage device. 


**Network virtualization** 



Any computer network has hardware elements such as switches, routers, and firewalls. An 
organization with offices in multiple geographic locations can have several different network 
technologies working together to create its enterprise network. Network virtualization is a 
process that combines all of these network resources to centralize administrative tasks. 
Administrators can adjust and control these elements virtually without touching the physical 
components, which greatly simplifies network management. 
The following are two approaches to network virtualization. 
   - Software-defined networking 


Software-defined networking (SDN) controls traffic routing by taking over routing 
management from data routing in the physical environment. For example, you can program 
your system to prioritize your video call traffic over application traffic to ensure consistent 
call quality in all online meetings. 
   - Network function virtualization  



Network function virtualization technology combines the functions of network appliances, 
such as firewalls, load balancers, and traffic analyzers that work together, to improve network 
performance. 
**Data virtualization** 



Modern organizations collect data from several sources and store it in different formats. They 
might also store data in different places, such as in a cloud infrastructure and an on-premises 
data center. Data virtualization creates a software layer between this data and the applications 
that need it. Data virtualization tools process an application‚Äôs data request and return results 
in a suitable format. Thus, organizations use data virtualization solutions to increase 
flexibility for data integration and support cross-functional data analysis. 


**Application virtualization** 
 
 
 Application virtualization pulls out the functions of applications to run on operating systems 
other than the operating systems for which they were designed. For example, users can run a 
Microsoft Windows application on a Linux machine without changing the machine 
configuration. To achieve application virtualization, follow these practices: 


- Application streaming ‚Äì Users stream the application from a remote server, so it runs only on 
the end user's device when needed.



- Server-based application virtualization ‚Äì Users can access the remote application from their 
browser or client interface without installing it. 


- Local application virtualization ‚Äì The application code is shipped with its own environment 
to run on all operating systems without changes. 


**Desktop virtualization** 


Most organizations have nontechnical staff that use desktop operating systems to run 
common business applications. For instance, you might have the following staff: 


- A customer service team that requires a desktop computer with Windows 10 and customer
relationship management software 


- A marketing team that requires Windows Vista for sales applications 
You can use desktop virtualization to run these different desktop operating systems on virtual 
machines, which your teams can access remotely. This type of virtualization makes desktop 
management efficient and secure, saving money on desktop hardware. The following are 
types of desktop virtualization.


- Virtual desktop infrastructure  


Virtual desktop infrastructure runs virtual desktops on a remote server. Your users can access 
them by using client devices. 


- Local desktop virtualization
In local desktop virtualization, you run the hypervisor on a local computer and create a virtual computer with a different operating system. You can switch between your local and virtual 
environment in the same way you can switch between applications.
